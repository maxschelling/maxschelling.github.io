  abstract  ="Controlled crystallization{,} melting and vitrification are important fundamental processes in nature and technology. However{,} the microscopic details of these fundamental phenomena still lack understanding{,} in particular how the cooling rate and presence of a wall influence the crystal nucleation and glass formation. Thermoresponsive microgels provide the possibility to study phase transitions at the single-particle level{,} owing to the ability to tune the particle size with temperature. In this study{,} we employ composite microgels consisting of a hard core and a crosslinked poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide-co-methacrylic acid) shell to study the crystallization of dense suspensions of soft colloids near a wall using confocal microscopy. We investigate the effect of the cooling rate on the fluid-to-solid transition close to the sample wall. The structures formed during cooling range from glassy in the case of a rapid temperature quench to crystalline when a slow cooling rate is used. Detailed analysis of the final structure reveals that the cooling rate also sets the degree of alignment of the crystal domains with the wall as a result of a balance between homogeneous and heterogeneous crystal nucleation. The results presented here yield valuable insight into the microscopic details of temperature-controlled crystallization near a wall. This understanding will help pave the way towards optimal crystallization conditions for microgel applications."

  abstract  = "Crystal defects crucially influence the properties of crystalline materials and have been extensively studied. Even for the simplest type of defect—the point defect—however, basic properties such as their diffusive behavior, and their interactions, remain elusive on the atomic scale. Here, we demonstrate in situ control over the creation of isolated point defects in a three-dimensional (3D) colloidal crystal allowing insight on a single-particle level. Our system consists of thermoresponsive microgel particles embedded in a crystal of nonresponsive colloids. Heating this mixed-particle system triggers the shrinking of the embedded microgels, which then vacate their lattice positions, creating vacancy-interstitial pairs. We use temperature-controlled confocal laser scanning microscopy to verify and visualize the formation of the point defects. In addition, by reswelling the microgels we quantify the local lattice distortion around an interstitial defect. Our experimental model system provides a unique opportunity to shed light on the interplay between point defects, on the mechanisms of their diffusion, on their interactions, and on collective dynamics."

  title = {Droplet-based assembly of magnetic superballs},
  journal = {Journal of Physics: Materials},
  abstract = {The self-assembly of materials driven by the inherent directionality of the constituent particles is of both practical and fundamental interest because it enables the fabrication of complex and hierarchical structures with tailored functionalities. By employing evaporation assisted self-assembly, we form opal-like structures with micro-sized magnetic superball particles. We study the structure formation of different superball shapes during evaporation of a dispersion droplet with in-situ small angle x-ray scattering with microradian resolution in the absence and presence of an external magnetic field. In the absence of a magnetic field, strong shape-dependent structures form as the water evaporates from the system. Applying a magnetic field to the droplet has a unique effect on the system; strong magnetic fields inhibit the growth of well-ordered assemblies due to the formation of out-of-equilibrium dipolar structures while lower magnetic fields allow particles to rearrange and orient without inhibition. In this work, we show how the superball assembly inside a droplet can be controlled by the magnetic field strength and the superball shape. The tunability of these parameters not only enables the controllable formation of macroscopic colloidal assemblies but also opens up possibilities for the development of functional materials with tailored properties on a macro-scale.}

  abstract = {We determined the phase boundaries of aqueous mixtures containing colloidal rod-like fd-viruses and polystyrene spheres using diffusing-wave spectroscopy and compared the results with free volume theory predictions. Excluded volume interactions in mixtures of colloidal rods and spheres lead to mediated depletion interactions. The strength and range of this attractive interaction depend on the concentrations of the particles, the length L and diameter D of the rods, and the radius R of the spheres. At strong enough attraction, this depletion interaction leads to phase separation. We experimentally determined the rod and sphere concentrations where these phase transitions occur by systematically varying the size ratios L/R and D/R and the aspect ratio L/D. This was done by using spheres with different radii and modifying the effective diameter of the rods through either the ionic strength of the buffer or anchoring a polymeric brush to the surface of the rods. The observed phase transitions were from a binary fluid to a colloidal gas/liquid phase coexistence that occurred already at very low concentrations due to the depletion efficiency of highly anisotropic rods. The experimentally measured phase transitions were compared to phase boundaries obtained using free volume theory (FVT), a well established theory for calculating the phase behavior of colloidal particles mixed with depletants. We find good correspondence between the experimental phase transitions and the theoretical FVT model where the excluded volume of the rod-like depletants was explicitly accounted for in both the reservoir and the system.},

  abstract = {In mixtures of colloids and nonadsorbing polyelectrolytes, a Donnan potential arises across the region between surfaces that are depleted of the polyelectrolyte and the rest of the system. This Donnan potential tends to shift the polyelectrolyte density profile toward the colloidal surface and leads to the local accumulation of polyelectrolytes. We derive a zero-field theory for the disjoining pressure between two parallel flat plates. The polyelectrolyte is allowed to enter the confined interplate region at the cost of a conformational free energy penalty. The resulting disjoining pressure shows a crossover to a repulsive regime when the interplate separation gets smaller than the size of the polyelectrolyte chain, followed by an attractive part. We find a quantitative match between the model and self-consistent field computations that take into account the full Poisson–Boltzmann electrostatics.},

  abstract = {Comprehensive calculations were performed to predict the phase behavior of large spherical colloids mixed with small spherical colloids that act as a depletant. To this end, the free volume theory (FVT) of Lekkerkerker et al. [Europhys. Lett. 20, 559 (1992)] is used as a basis and is extended to explicitly include the hard-sphere character of colloidal depletants into the expression for the free volume fraction. Taking the excluded volume of the depletants into account in both the system and the reservoir provides a relation between the depletant concentration in the reservoir and that in the system that accurately matches with computer simulation results of Dijkstra et al. [Phys. Rev. E 59, 5744 (1999)]. Moreover, the phase diagrams for highly asymmetric mixtures with size ratios q ≲ 0.2 obtained by using this new approach corroborate simulation results significantly better than earlier FVT applications to binary hard-sphere mixtures. The phase diagram of a binary hard-sphere mixture with a size ratio of q = 0.4, where a binary interstitial solid solution is formed at high densities, is investigated using a numerical free volume approach. At this size ratio, the obtained phase diagram is qualitatively different from previous FVT approaches for hard-sphere and penetrable depletants but again compares well with simulation predictions.},
